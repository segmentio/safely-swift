# Safely for Swift
---

Safely is a library intended to make calling system level, unknown, or 3rd party code a LITTLE bit safer.  It does so by catching any unhandled exceptions or throws and allow the caller to treat them as a Swift error and ignore, attempt to recover, or even just log the issue somewhere useful.
